                                <p class="dialogues second-person">
                                    <b> MA: </b> Right, kind of nausea. And so, this is one thing, my early memories of finding out about Asco and obviously knowing what the word [<i>asco</i>] means and where it comes from. 
                                </p>

                                    <b> MA: </b> I&#39;ve always been interested in <i> that </i> way of making work, in a similar vein. That word &#34;nausea&#34; and what that may mean.
                                </p>

                                    <b> PV: </b> Right, it&#39;s almost how I just used it. Things that happened in my neighborhood would make me sick to my stomach and I couldn&#39;t ignore them. I knew I was going to be an artist since I was a kid, but I couldn&#39;t ignore what was going on in the community and it would turn my stomach literally. So that&#39;s: <i> &#34;me da asco.&#34; </i> It&#39;s upsetting my stomach to see abuse or a variety of negative things. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    But, what I remember about the word <i> asco, </i> is our own work gave us <i> asco. </i> So, when we hung a show one day, we were rushing, half of it was wet, it was on the wall, and I remember looking at it and going &#34;Oh my God, this work gives me <i> asco.</i>&#34; But you have to remember how long ago it was that we made this work. I was barely out of high school, I was very young and I&#39;m having to recollect these memories from a trillion years ago.

                                    <b> MA: </b> I feel like we&#39;re already talking about these things, but in terms of your environment, your space, maybe you could talk about East LA in the 60s and 70s?
                                </p>
                                <p class="dialogues first-person">
                                    <b> PV: </b> I&#39;ll say 70s, because in the 60s I was in high school. So, the 70s was when I was active. You were asking about the environment in East LA at that time? It was pretty horrible. Basically, because I looked different, I dressed different, and my friends did&#8212;or mainly Gronk, I was close with Gronk and Edmundo Meza, another great artist. There was so much police brutality. So even if I went out in my little Volkswagen, driving around&#8212;because I think the family had fixed up this old Volkswagen for me, they made it all pretty and it looked new.
                                </p>
                                <p class="dialogues second-person">
                                    <b> MA: </b> Did you have a bug?
                                </p>
                                <p class="dialogues first-person">
                                    <b> PV: </b> Yeah, a Volkswagen Bug. It had that old window that was ovaI. The cops were constantly pulling me over, constantly. I&#39;d get out, they&#39;d search, they&#39;d look for drugs in your car&#8212;just ridiculous. Even for a woman. I had a friend who was born with only one arm. We&#39;re in the car one day, there come the cops off Whittier Boulevard, they&#39;re pulling us over again. They said you have to open your purses. And we ask why? And they say, &#34;She could have a gun in her purse&#34;… a woman with one arm? We didn&#39;t have iPhones, so we couldn&#39;t record it, we could only share the information. My own mother didn&#39;t even believe me. So, one day, they pull us over and my mother is in the car now. I said, &#34;I told you mom.&#34;
                                    <br><br>
                                    And the other thing was, being in high school, the teachers that didn&#39;t teach&#8212;not all of them but the majority of them. I remember English, which I&#39;m terrible at grammar, and she&#39;d give you the book and on the blackboard, she&#39;d write to turn to page nine and read that chapter. And that was it. They left and they didn&#39;t even teach you anything. So that&#39;s when the walkouts happened [East L.A. walkouts, 1968]. Basically, the college students were coming to the school to inform us; they were already aware of the outdated books, the racism in the schools.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then I&#39;d encounter racism on the street. I was in a parking lot and this little child peaked up and called me &#34;dirty Mexican&#34; or some other racial slur. This is a child, they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re saying. I&#39;m sure their parent was in the car telling them what to say. Somebody even spit in my face, a white man when I was walking downtown. That&#39;s one part, and then being a woman, nobody wants to listen to you.
                                </p>

I want to look like that.&#34; I would reinterpret that look. What&#39;s funny is that I realized later, people don&#39;t wear that on the street, Patssi, but you are! Maybe it&#39;s for a photoshoot, right? But the other goal was that I&#39;m so sick of the stereotype of what we look like. Beauty was not Brown, and why not? We are beautiful, we&#39;re smart, we&#39;re talented, we&#39;re all these things that we aren&#39;t depicted as anywhere. Even in Hollywood, where are we? We&#39;re absent, we&#39;re nowhere. That was one of my goals: to bring my culture, my people to the forefront. Not only the beauty, but the intelligence and the talent.

Where they are so historic and grand that they should actually move and be in other parts of the city to recognize important moments. Making things just for your own audience that understands it is very important, but it gets stuck there. The documentation seems valuable, because it is also able to be digested elsewhere. That is really powerful, with photography in mind.

                                    <b> PV: </b> Because these are performance, they have to be documented. But you&#39;re making an important point, you&#39;re bringing that trailer and that signage and all that stuff to a whole different audience. A lot of you are doing that already. As far as talking about the murals, how they&#39;re just here in this community, and if those pieces could be moved around. Even Judy Baca, by putting that mural in LACMA <i> [The Great Wall of Los Angeles], </i> she made it more accessible to more people. Or like you with that trailer.

I loved adventure as a really young girl growing up with my brothers. When I was introduced to graffiti art, I just fell in love with it&#8212;the graffiti on the freeways, on the auto shops. I started tagging and I kind of just fell in love with it, you know? It came to me naturally, I think. I didn&#39;t have a lot of friends that did graffiti. I started tagging in 1995 and in 1999, I came up with the name Timoi. I wrote &#34;Trapped In My Own Imagination&#34; on a piece of paper, and I really liked and related to it. I got the acronym, and I started to write.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Before that, I used to write <i> calo, </i> which is a slang word in [Guatemalan] Spanish. It&#39;s hard to describe in English, but it&#39;s something that impacts you. Something like when you say, &#34;Oh, I feel that. Oh, it&#39;s on my <i> calo&#34; </i> in Spanish. I started to do characters around LA. And then, instead of letters, I focused more on characters. Later on in life, I met more graffiti artists that taught me more of graffiti art&#39;s basics. So I was a &#34;toy&#34; for a long time. A toy is somebody that doesn&#39;t really know the basics of graffiti and they&#39;re just out there tagging and doing graffiti, but not really that great, you know? I learned a lot from other artists that taught me a lot of techniques on how to use the spray can. Of course this came with practice, because practicing on your own, that&#39;s how you grow. That&#39;s how graffiti came to me.

So I started tagging his name around school. Then, his best friend took me under his wing and taught me real style because, you know, style is very specific.

I met the real writers who did subway trains and it took months and months to convince them to take me to paint subway trains.

So, it was also exciting that people wanted to just throw money at us to do stuff&#8212;that was easy. Both worlds were going on strong at the same time.

                                    <b> T: </b> I definitely agree with Lady Pink about graffiti not necessarily being hip-hop. I think it started more as a political thing. There are just so many different people in graffiti that they don&#39;t necessarily fall into just people that are into hip-hop. But going to high school and getting into my art classes, a lot of artists started to influence my work. Not necessarily the work itself, but just the idea: How was I gonna approach my art&#8212;like Salvador Dalí, Frida Kahlo, Gustav Klimt, and of course, Picasso. I really got interested in how he did all his series…when he had his blue period. Not until 2003, when I was twenty-three years old and I wanted it to just really focus on my art, really think about what I was doing. And that&#39;s when I started the &#34;Killer Calo&#34; series, the dolls without the nose.

                                    <b> LP: </b> Okay, so going back to the hip-hop exposure, I could see it in my high school. Like I said, kids from every corner of New York would go there. And only some kids that lived in some neighborhoods were exposed to hip-hop, yet everyone did graffiti. That had been around for a long time. More than a decade before the music and the dancing started. And it had its own rules, its own subculture happening strongly.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Again, depending on what neighborhood you lived in, you were exposed to this. There was a lot of graffiti going down when they were listening to Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd and had nothing to do with hip-hop whatsoever. But it was more the marketing and advertising companies in the early eighties that lumped it all together because it made a neat little package to sell and market to the mainstream.
                                    <br><br>
                                    So they just tossed it all in there, regardless of what graffiti writers wanted. So wherever we went, we were bombarded by hip-hop music all the time at all the events. And everyone just assumed that&#39;s what we were all into. That&#39;s what we&#39;re all about. One big stereotype: &#34;This is how you talk. This is how you dress. That is the music you listen to. This is the art that you do.&#34; Regardless of how focused us artists really were. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I like to break that stereotype. And so that&#39;s why I said, I don&#39;t believe that graffiti is part of that. I&#39;ll give it that it all has grassroots beginnings. You know, the music, the dance, the art, it&#39;s all invented by kids not knowing anything of what they were inventing. And they were just making stuff up to have fun with their friends. Then suddenly we&#39;re birthing a whole culture here. We have the same grassroots beginnings. But after that, it depends on your own upbringing.

                                    <b> T: </b> Yeah, for me growing up in LA, we didn&#39;t really have the subway. We had the buses, we had the billboards, and we had the freeways and that was basically our playground. That was our studio.
                                    <br><br>
                                    That&#39;s how we practice: we got up. For me, it was the billboards or even on the freeway, definitely what we call the &#34;heavens.&#34; So when I did billboards, it was like just this high: this adventure of just getting up there and risking. I mean, I even fell off a rooftop once and that was funny and a little scary because I&#39;m laying on the ground out of breath. Adventure and feeling the adrenaline of coming down and seeing your name up there. Even if it got buffed. Just the experience of doing it was a lot of fun.
                                    <br><br>
                                    That&#39;s the difference from New York. They have the subways and that&#39;s just such a big, big deal. I&#39;ve done a couple of trains here in California, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same thing.

                                    <b> LP: </b> No, no, no. The geography of New York and the accessibility to the subways makes every corner of the city within our reach. And my generation of the seventies and early eighties was all purely getting on the subway trains. We didn&#39;t do walls. We didn&#39;t do street tagging. We were not focused on, you know, destroying people&#39;s buildings or neighborhoods. We went right for the subways. That was what everyone wanted to achieve was a nice old car or top to bottom whole car or something like that.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And I went outside of my own neighborhood. They didn&#39;t park the trains in my neighborhood. They parked the trains at the ends of the lines in most of the ghetto neighborhoods of New York. So I really had to go through some colorful neighborhoods, industrial areas, scary areas where, you know, young girls should not be walking. I did have to walk with a posse when I was active, but even to get to meet my friends, I&#39;m alone. And then meet up with the friends and small group of five, six people, you know? So it was all accessible.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And the reason why graffiti got better in New York City was the rivalry on the subway trains. It would roll from neighborhood to neighborhood and groups would see each other&#39;s work and everyone had to, you know, top their work. And the trains went all the way from the Bronx down to the depths of Brooklyn and kids that never even met would compete against each other and work got better. In Philadelphia, graffiti started a little earlier than in New York, but it did not get on the subway trains. It stayed very regional in specific train stations and areas you had to go to their neighborhoods to see their tags. So I had to go into some colorful neighborhoods and I didn&#39;t want my family or my mom to see my work, so I went to other areas.

                                    <b> LP: </b>  I went above ground around the same time that I was underground. So it all came in a hurry. When I was a teenager, galleries and exhibition spaces were asking for work and I was still painting underground. The walls didn&#39;t happen until the nineties when the subway trains finally became fully clean, but we had already been above ground painting for galleries and doing legal stuff until I started dating my husband in 1993. They were all about getting permission walls and giving all sorts of people access to paint in the daytime, all kinds of other graffiti writers. I&#39;d already been painting in the daytime for nine years.
                                    <br><br>
                                    But other people who were not so fortunate would need more permission walls so that they could just flex their skill and stuff like that. With my portfolio, it was easy enough for me to get permission walls&#8212;find the landlord, approach them and show them all this artwork I do and they give me their walls. So that was happening in the nineties, but that was more for recreational mural painting, just getting permission spots, inviting your friends and doing up half a city block on a weekend. And that&#39;s what we did for fun.

They&#39;ve got muscles all over the place. I don&#39;t know where they go. But women are soft, they&#39;re sensual, they&#39;re easy to draw, I&#39;m really good at it.

And I think that is another reason why I would really just kind of go solo a lot of the time. I would see in other countries or other states how women were more embraced and more taken care of. But in LA, I mean, even still, guys are like, no girls in the crew. And they&#39;re just very immature about the whole thing.

                                    So, for me, I was very feminist growing up because of that. If it&#39;s hard for women in the art world, it&#39;s even harder for women in the graffiti world. And so, doing female characters just kind of came out naturally. I was very feminist. I did grow up with this, like, women power kind of thing, you know. In addition to doing female characters, I also do trans, intersex, gay characters, because I wanted to bring visibility to not just women, not just male. And I do paint men as well, because they are part of the spectrum.

                                    But mainly, I do femme characters or female identifying characters, because I wanted it to bring that attention to women within the graffiti and the art world. And, what gets guys though, gets their respect, hands down, is letter styles. If you can rock some amazing letters, guys don&#39;t care what gender you are. You are most welcomed on the crew: &#34;Those are some rocking letters. That&#39;s amazing.&#34; If you can rock style, that is one thing that wins the guys over, you know, definitely.

For both of you, how you think of and see an older and younger generation of folks working in street art, and how those transitions have happened. Something that I&#39;ve seen, even in my lifetime growing up in Philadelphia with a lot of anti-graffiti mural campaigns, and people my age feeling really resistant to Mural Arts programming, and rejecting muralism due to its consideration as something better than graffiti. For example, street art being introduced into advertising in very explicit kinds of ways where I sometimes see a piece and think it&#39;s a mural, but instead it&#39;s an ad for Grubhub. And especially the commercialization of street art gives people opportunities, but also pushes the aesthetics even further into the mainstream.

I was like, no, that is special because in LA, we have to grow our gardens in the yard and I don&#39;t even pay attention to my garden in the yard. But you have this beautiful garden. I just want to say that was amazing. And it was really nice to meet you back then and I was super intimidated and super excited to meet you.

And so I&#39;m curious if migration in that context kind of has shaped any aspect of your practices as artists.

I migrated when I was seven years old. And I&#39;ve been raised in New York my whole life. So that rarely ever shows up in my work. I don&#39;t refer to my immigration status in any way. It opened some doors when I was doing graffiti, because everybody else was a minority. So that was good being Latina. A lot of doors were opened that way. But I don&#39;t really show that in my work very much. Rarely, rarely do I show that. I do commissions and then I have to use imagery from South America and such. At most, it&#39;s by request. But then I will do imagery from all sorts of other different places as well, from Africa to Asia to you name it.

I grew up really proud of being Guatemalan. I didn&#39;t become a citizen until this year, actually.I got my U.S. passport and everything. I&#39;m really excited about that, but for a long time, I was just really proud of being Guatemalan. And I did a lot of work on women empowerment and activism on violence against women, especially in Guatemala, because in Guatemala, there&#39;s what we call the femicide&#8212;a genocide by the killing of women specifically.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And so I did a lot of work on that. I went with some delegations to Guatemala and I did graffiti that was inspired or just like to bring attention to the issue. And even here, I did some artwork about that. And so specifically, like immigration or migration, I mean, not necessarily exactly about that, but I think more like eradicating violence against women.

                                    <b> YC: </b> First of all, that was a really important period in time, just in terms of being a community-based artist and trying to find ways to advance as an artist but also to share that with a Chicanx/Latinx audience. After undergraduate school, I worked in Long Beach for a long time&#8212;that&#39;s actually where I got to meet Judithe and got to know her better. I worked with some other amazing women, mainly young women and single mothers and tried to produce public art and also address some of the social issues. I didn&#39;t have any real guidance in terms of muralism. There was one guide, but I didn&#39;t know about it until much later&#8212;it was put out by Chicago and distributed by the Social and Public Art Research Center (SPARC). I did, eventually, work on <i> The Great Wall [of Los Angeles </i> designed by Judy Baca] where I got experience and met some amazing artists working on it. Truly my experience was always hit-and-miss, I felt that I lacked all the guidance that I needed. I worked through a summer youth employment program&#8212;I think you remember that Judithe?

History: A Mexican Perspective] </i> and gained more experience there&#8212;the logistics of doing all of that. For me, it was really just piecing everything together and trying to connect with other women artists because that was really important to me. I have to be frank and just say that I wish that I had a little bit more guidance in different ways from more experienced artists and could have produced more murals when I was younger. At this time, I have some more limited mobility issues. There were some resources that were slowly being developed, but not as accessible as I would have liked at the time. What I started to say is that I wish I had done more murals when I was younger and had the energy and physicality to do it. Therefore, I always think of myself as an artist who&#39;s done murals. And I do call myself a muralist, but there are some really amazing muralists that have just dedicated their life to doing that. I&#39;ve done the best that I could with what I had! And the good thing is, I&#39;ve been able to mentor some younger artists. It&#39;s just amazing to see that there are so many great, young muralists in general, but Chicanx/Latinx women that are doing murals are pretty impressive. And of course, I also got to work with Judithe just for a fast moment&#8212;I don&#39;t know if you remember, you were doing a mural at Estrada Court…

It didn&#39;t seem all that hard until I started doing it myself&#8212;this is really hard to do! Gridding the wall, getting up on that scaffold. The first time, the mural for this project around the city, I only had one assistant, who was my cousin. It was kind of learn by doing and it was done entirely in spray can. It was a graffiti mural&#8212;I think it was probably the first graffiti mural per se, because there was tagging but I had never seen an artist paint a mural with a spray can.

                                    <b> JH: </b> When I graduated from Otis in &#39;74 with my MFA, my thesis had discussed the symbols and iconography being used in the streets. Those of us who were the next around and graduating art schools, were incorporating those things into our theses and in our own work. Which all of us did. We mirrored all these new things we were learning about ourselves. We hadn&#39;t learned about Mesoamerica or the Conquest in college. As we learned that, we started putting that on the walls. My experience was like yours; I wasn&#39;t trained to do it. But, it didn&#39;t seem all that hard to figure out if you kept it simple. And when Carlos and I got to Ramona, I had a wonderful assistant in him. We designed two murals that were women empowerment murals. You know, he was the only enlightened man that I knew in those days… everyone else was still struggling with their <i> machismo </i> and he was not. He was actually very progressive and wanted to include women in the mix. And so, we decided to do women&#39;s empowerment. He designed his, I designed mine, and then we assisted each other on our murals. And then people dropped by, like all these women from Long Beach! And Kent Twitchell dropped by. I had several friends who would spend a day helping us paint and that&#39;s how we learned.

                                    What it was like being a woman? I always felt as if my continued participation really hinged on whether or not I could deal with the way guys did things and to find my place&#8212;not like them, but to be able to hold my ground and have a voice was a little tricky at first. But then I figured it out, you had to really be, not so much to be a woman but be someone who had strength and skills that were needed. We&#39;re just talking as workers here. So, on that basis, I claimed a peer-level relationship with those guys, and we got along very well as a consequence. And then I was able to help on several large projects around the city like you were. They were always looking for help once the renaissance blew up all over Los Angeles. We were all invited to do painting with lots of people&#8212;I painted with Kent Twitchell, Leonard Castellanos, Norma Montoya&#8212;a lot of people who were working in those days. You had to balance your desires to do certain things on the walls with the desires of the people. There was usually no set design.

It gives you a certain amount of power when they come late and you tell them, &#34;No, no, no you&#39;re not doing this today. You have to work on this section or that section.&#34; They would take that direction because, after all, some organization had been established by me or some other woman in the group.

                                    <b> YC: </b> A lot of learning, for sure. You know, Judithe, I didn&#39;t have that same experience&#8212;I didn&#39;t work with a lot of male artists at the time, although I respected them. I was really interested to hear that you worked with Charles White in your graduate experience, because about six months after I graduated from Santa Cruz, I went directly to Long Beach. This is a program I wanted to mention to Adela, too. One of the ways in which we did murals at that time was through the CETA program&#8212;Comprehensive Education and Training Act, right? It was a government program not just for the arts but in other areas that funded non-profit organizations to do projects. I worked in the Long Beach community as a CETA artist-in-residence in the local centro there. I worked for a while at SPARC and eventually ended up at Self Help Graphics. After almost twelve years of working in community, I decided I wanted to go back for my MFA. I applied to UCLA. It was difficult, even though the UCLA Art Department is renowned, they were so narrow in terms of their understanding of art by people of color, particularly Chicanx/Latinx artists. When they reviewed my work, they didn&#39;t have much to say and they didn&#39;t have the humility to ask, &#34;Can you tell me about this?&#34; They would just make assumptions that it was decorative, they didn&#39;t understand my symbolism&#8212;all their labels. Though I did learn from some of the professors, in and of itself it was a learning experience. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I am sharing all of this because most people are most familiar with <i> La Ofrenda, </i> which is a dedication to immigrants and Dolores Huerta. I got my committee together and it was hard to get a committee because professors were already obligated. I wanted to do a mural and they really discouraged it. It was the attitude that Chicanos do murals, why don&#39;t you try and do something different? And I said, &#34;I feel that this is a valid area of concentration and study. I want to explore murals and I want to work in muralism.&#34; It just happened to coincide with a grant from the city through SPARC. The first time I applied, I didn&#39;t get it, but the second time applying, I got it and it just happened to coincide with my thesis. So eventually they allowed me to do the mural, but I had to replicate part of the mural in the gallery. Not only did I do the mural in the community, but I had to do part of it&#8212;and it was just a grid primarily and the design of a section of the mural&#8212;in the gallery.

One a younger woman artist, and another really an established artist and amazing artist in his own right. But they didn&#39;t have anything to say to me. So, I was able to invite another outside person from another department or even from the community. And I just said, &#34;Okay, I gotta do something here, because this is not happening.&#34; So, I approached one of the Chicana professors in the Theater Department, Edit Villarreal.

But I still have to tell you when my committee members came to the site… the top part of the mural was traditionally done in acrylic and the bottom part I wanted to be done in spray can because, at the time, my mural was located across the street from the Belmont Tunnel, which was an important space for all the graf artists. I invited a couple of the graf artists to be part of my crew. So when my committee members came they briefly looked at my mural and go, &#34;We want to see what&#39;s happening over there!&#34; And of course, it&#39;s amazing what they&#39;re doing, but there was no interest.

Maybe that&#39;s because the professors at Otis, by and large, were either first generation Americans from Europe or they had immigrated after World War II. They brought a different view about what the universe of art could encompass. So when I told them what I wanted to do was create a suite of works, I was working on large-size paper murals and in spray can as an urban expression of this rising culture in the <i> barrio, </i> none of them knew what it was about, but when they saw my sketches and ideas they said, &#34;Go for it!&#34; No judgment.

I do not know if you read Arlene Dávila&#39;s book, <i> [Latinx Art: Artists, Markets, and Politics], </i> the last book she wrote about how they&#39;d managed to exclude contemporary Latin Americans working in the United States by this clever use of the term &#34;Latin art,&#34; which then they only bring the art from South America from people who are essentially the white descendants of colonizers and other Europeans, but not the art of the indigenous. And it&#39;s been a way to exclude us since 1519. In a funny way, I was talking to a friend of mine who happens to be Jewish, and I said to him: &#34;One of the things that maybe you don&#39;t realize is that mainstream American society never knows as much about us as we know about them. Because we&#39;re required to learn it if we&#39;re going to survive. The lucky ones who have the college education, who are intent on using that education and ambition to pursue a career in your world.

How long has it been since they&#39;ve actually shown the work of people of color in the way that they should have been for years? Black artists broke into museums before we did, but they still don&#39;t get the kind of representation… Women don&#39;t get the kind of representation in their collections or in their exhibitions.

You&#39;re Americans, you deserve a place in those institutions. I remember when the Charles White retrospective was in the planning prior to 2019 when it toured the United States in three different cities, I became involved as a consultant when the two curators who were putting that retrospective together came to Los Angeles to interview some of White&#39;s students. They were two young women and I invited them to lunch here in the studio. We had a really nice visit and they asked me if I was interested in becoming a consultant because I knew Charlie very well. And I said, &#34;I&#39;d love to, whatever I can do to help.&#34; And then finally&#8212;you know you get to be a certain age, Yreina, back me up on this, you can say things that you would not have said when you were younger when your career was on the line&#8212;I don&#39;t really care! One curator was from MoMA, the other was from the Art Institute of Chicago, and they&#39;re never going to show me, I can say whatever I want!

We come out to Los Angeles, and we see this dynamic renaissance going on here on the West Coast. There are so many different kinds of people who are indigenous to this hemisphere, and we take this information back to our institutions and when it comes to meetings when we&#39;re deciding the exhibition calendar or acquisitions, we bring that up and then it goes to the next level and that&#39;s where those recommendations die.&#34; It&#39;s not that they haven&#39;t heard it: it&#39;s still a certain level that governs what happens.

It was interesting to see how he did go to New York, and he absorbed as much as he could, but he found that <i> ambiente </i>&#8212;that atmosphere&#8212;was really stifling his own creative voice. And that&#39;s when he decided to come back to Los Angeles and that&#39;s what nourished him, right?

For me it was also very intentional: yes, we need some women-centered murals just because of the role that women play in our culture, politics, and everyday life!

                                    <b> JH: </b> Absolutely. We were giving our communities a cultural education about the importance of women in the past that needed to be brought into the future. It empowered young women to say, &#34;Heck, I can be a Brown Beret. I can do this. I can play this part in the revolution.&#34; And they started doing it. I think if they had not had visible signs that women can empower themselves given the political dynamic we lived in… people like Dolores Huerta and Lola de la Riva. It was these early examples. Lola was this amazing woman doing things that you would think her husband would never have allowed her to do. There was a cohort of women in Long Beach that were quite amazing&#8212;Margie Rodriguez and Janet Padilla. I was close to them, I wish I knew where they were now. Definitely Lola was an inspiration, she was a married woman with kids and responsibilities, she was just so active in the community and a force to be reckoned with. I had an example in my mother, she was like that. She was a political animal and deeply embedded, of course she was a Democrat. We help each other out hand by hand over generations, women do that.

In particular I had close relationships with different poets and artists and filmmakers and we informed each other. I was on the tail end of that first generation, I think Judithe was the first generation, and so we had to really learn from each other. Whatever the situation may be, I tried to take away something that I learned from a person. I see that in some of the younger women, I hope that gets carried on. Because I really had a Chicana feminist perspective, maybe I was more critical of the <i> machismo </i>&#8212;not vocally but in the way I approached things. The women&#39;s artist community was so important to my advancement.

Siqueiros. She saw these people and she would tell me the greatest stories! I loved her dearly; she was an inspiration. She was a woman who had raised two sons and left a husband years before. She would never speak well of him, but you could tell there must&#39;ve been something awful. She left Mexico and raised her sons alone.

All those messages were very relevant in their time, but I also think that the next generation deserves to be able to use that space to create their own message. As all three of us know, there are some issues that have never been resolved that over the last forty years have come back to haunt us again.

                                    <b> JH: </b> You know who the best critics are? Our people have become the most incredible art critics that any group of artists has ever had! Any mural that immediately gets tagged is because either that artist made the mistake of not including their plans or discussing their plans with the locals who have to live with this thing. And, the arrogance of thinking you&#39;re giving them a gift absolutely astounds me. And then they wonder why it doesn&#39;t last. My mural at Ramona Gardens was restored in 2016 and it was painted in &#39;77. The only thing wrong with it in 2016 was that the paint had faded. Nobody ever attacked my mural and I think it&#39;s because the subject matter had been approved by the community, it&#39;s what they wanted to see. It honored women in a way they felt had not been spoken about&#8212;their grandmothers, their sisters, their aunties. And they loved it. And in 2016, I had a crew of young women who went with me to do the restoration. One of the women, she&#39;s pretty well known, her name is Basa. There are some that are legacy murals that should be preserved, but by and large a lot of them missed the connection with the community.

                                    <b> YC: </b> I definitely agree with that. I also think that the way in which murals were done earlier, more community perspective, input, and actually having community work on the murals&#8212;they felt invested. It&#39;s interesting, with <i> La Ofrenda </i> it was really preserved, protected, respected for years and years and years. And then about eight years ago, ten years ago, it started getting graffiti and I think that&#39;s really a disconnect. Also, the disregard for understanding what hard work a mural is, everything that goes into it. There is a disconnect over generations in understanding that and wanting to maintain and respect that. And, you know, it's just gotten really complicated as an issue because graffiti is amazing and its own artform, but there&#39;s a lack of communication between the artists and some of the younger artists that are tagging in the community.

But, the Movimiento did a great job of telling us who we were, because we didn&#39;t know who we were either until we started painting murals, making art, and participating in this cultural revolution. That hasn&#39;t continued and you have these kids who don&#39;t know about Mexico, the Revolution, the Conquest.

It fuels you to keep pushing. With anything, we figure it out. At least we feel like we&#39;re trying to move something forward, if not us then another generation is going to pick it up and really push for that representation.
