              <i> Five Decades of Chicane Muralism in Los Angeles, 1972-2019</i> brings together six works of public art made in Los Angeles by an intergenerational group of Chicane artists, including one artist born in Guatemala, in the digital space for the first time. At heart, the show follows the evolution and expansion of muralism as a community-driven mode of artistic production that has been integral to the formation of Chicane visual and cultural identity. On freeway underpasses, prominent thoroughfares, buildings, community centers, bars, and commercial venues, the visual artists in this exhibition have taken hold of outdoor spaces and walls as a platform for political activism, social commentary, and identity formation. This cohort, including Asco, Barbara Carrasco, Yreina Cervántez, rafa esparza and Gabriela Ruiz, Judithe Hernández, and Timoi, work across media, from painting and drawing to performance, installation, and digital art. Yet, each has experimented with and seriously engaged the large-scale mural to celebrate and empower, in addition to levying social critique and amplifying activist causes. A driving force for many of these projects follows the call to examine the lived experience of Brown individuals&#8212;how inequalities stemming from settler colonialism manifest in the citywide dynamics of police brutality, education disparities, economic disenfranchisement, and labor exploitation. At the same time, murals afforded space for these artists to depict and dictate their communities and ancestral stories in their own terms, adding complexity to reductive visions of Chicane Los Angeles, the largest concentration of Mexicans in the United States.
              <br><br>
              Developing alongside the Chicano Movement (El Movimiento), from the beginning of the Los Angeles mural movement, the mass format provided public space for artists to generate imagery that both asserted the presence of Chicane communities and catalyzed the period&#39;s revolutionary ideology&#8212;attesting to the nascent intersectionality between racial identity, labor reform, anti-war protest, and liberatory politics. Out of this activity, Chicane artists developed collectives and community groups that aided these visualizations and aimed at the preservation and perpetuation of the mural as a vehicle for underrepresented identities. In 1976, the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) was founded by a team of artists to support public art throughout the city&#8212;&#34;taking its name from the notion that it takes only a spark to start a prairie fire.&#34; Earlier, in 1970, Self Help Graphics, a community art space was established and later expanded in an old gymnasium in Boyle Heights where it flourished into a printmaking atelier, exhibition venue, and performance space. The mural, as a public space, was a political act. Entering the streets paralleled those seismic demonstrations like the National Chicano Moratorium Against the Vietnam War on August 29, 1970&#8212;a public demonstration on the boulevards of East L.A. against the impact of the war on Mexican-American life (eligible Mexican-American men were disproportionately enlisted in the army and suffered significant casualties during the war). The march quickly turned violent as the Los Angeles Sheriff&#39;s Department tear-gassed and opened fire on the crowd, resulting in three deaths. 
              <br><br>
              Thematically, these murals center and pay homage to women (historic, mythological, and invented), while also honoring those marginalized for their sexual and gender identities. In the words of one of the participating artists, Judithe Hernández: &#34;We made the conscious decision to design murals dedicated to women in response to all the male-dominated subject matter of most Chicano murals of the era.&#34; When awarded a mural commission at the Ramona Gardens Housing Project, both Hernández and her collaborator Carlos Almaraz jointly decided to undertake murals on the subject of women&#39;s empowerment. These visualizations countered disempowering stereotypes, which typically domesticated or overly sexualized Chicane women. For other artists in the show, community leaders like Dolores Huerta were natural subjects for venerative murals as in Yreina Cervántez&#39;s mural, <i> La Ofrenda </i> (1989). Barbara Carrasco&#39;s portable mural <i> L.A. History: A Mexican Perspective </i> (1981) narrates a long history of Los Angeles through the flowing tendrils of La Reina de Los Ángeles (the Princess of Los Angeles), a protagonist who demonstrates strength and perseverance amid an emblem of feminine beauty. In Asco&#39;s <i> Walking Mural, </i> the only woman member of the artist group, Patssi Valdez, performed a subversive characterization of the Virgen de Guadalupe, a Pop reinterpretation imparting an image of Chicane womanhood that ran counter to pervasive tropes propagated by the masculinist mainstream media. 
              <br><br>
              As muralism continues to give space to expansive identities, contemporary artists Timoi, rafa esparza, and Gabriela Ruiz have produced works uplifting long standing queer kinship subjugated by conservative values. In Timoi&#39;s graffiti mural at the Higher Path made in 2011, the challenges facing women artists informed their choice of subject matter. As Timoi explained in an interview conducted for this show: &#34;If it&#39;s hard for women in the art world, it&#39;s even harder for women in the graffiti world. And so, doing female characters just kind of came out naturally. I was very feminist. In addition to doing female characters, I also do trans, intersex, gay characters, because I wanted to bring visibility to not just women, not just male. And I do paint men as well, because they are part of the spectrum.&#34; Furthermore, Timoi&#39;s Guatemalan origins signal to the utility of muralism for artists migrating from Central America&#8212;throughout the late 20th century, a wave of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras (the so-called &#34;Northern Triangle) has fluctuated as a result of civil conflict, persistent poverty, and, in no small part, United States&#39; interventions across the region. After immigrating to Los Angeles from Guatemala with their family, Timoi was suddenly surrounded by Chicane murals and graffiti work, influencing their practice&#39;s development. For esparza and Ruiz, the anti-LGBTQIA+ politics of Mexico and the Chicane community in Los Angeles motivated them to recast the Mexican printmaker José Guadalupe Posada&#39;s print broadside documenting a police raid of a drag ball in a wealthy enclave in Mexico City at the turn of the twentieth century. Their mural, <i> Nostra Fiesta </i> (2019), currently adorns the facade of a crucial space for the queer Mexican and Central American communities in Downtown Los Angeles, The New Jalisco Bar. 
              <br><br>
              In their intersectional focus on women, femme subjects, migrants, and other marginalized groups, these artists evolved the visual aesthetic and ideology of muralism to better interrogate social stereotypes and discrimination within and beyond their communities. In the 1970s, these radical gestures overlapped with civil rights reform, feminism, and gay liberation. Yet up to the present, murals by Chicane artists address the recurrent and continuous sociocultural conditions which hamper artistic access like limited opportunities within the &#34;mainstream&#34; art world, sexism and homophobia within Mexican-American communities, and police surveillance and governmental censorship. With these goals, the works in the show evidence a categorical expansion of the mural, encompassing experimental intermedial practices, performances recorded by photographs, censored works that were relegated to storage or permanent destruction, or graffiti tags and imagery. Over time, the works in this exhibition have become cornerstones of the neighborhoods in which they exist, cherished memories of those who live among or have witnessed them, or observed the longtail of their legacies in photographs. 
              <br><br>
              Another unmissable aspect of the murals presented in this exhibition is each artists&#39; embrace of collectivity and collaboration. Asco, of course, worked in a group to realize visual protest through various creative practices. Hernández&#39;s mural for the Ramona Gardens Housing Projects was designed in concert with Carlos Almaraz&#39;s mural <i> La Adelita, </i> jointly asserting the role of women in social revolution. Carrasco paid homage to her team of assistants by painting their portraits in a panel of <i> L.A. History: A Mexican Perspective. </i> As Carrasco recently reflected: &#34;The artists, when you&#39;re working on a mural, the first thing is that you have to be compatible and respect one another. I liked Yreina and I thought she would be perfect. She&#39;s good with people, good with kids.&#34; In a conversation with Hernández on the occasion of this show, Cervántez also reminisced about coming to Ramona Gardens for a day with a group of other women artists from Long Beach to help paint sections of <i> Homenaje a las Mujeres de Aztlán. </i> Later, Cervántez hired Chicane and Central American student workers as mural assistants when she earned the commission for <i> La Ofrenda. </i> She also included the work of two poets and a graffiti artist, crediting each by name within the composition. Nostra Fiesta is the work of an artist pair. Even as we write this introductory text, we learn of upcoming collaborations between the artists in this show, which bridge new intergenerational dialogues. 
              <br><br>
              With the communal logic of the mural comes a vivid reality for many of the artists in this exhibition: these works, by speaking to current audiences about the past or a still-to-be realized future, offer themselves temporally to those who pass by or spend time in front of these objects. In some cases, like Timoi&#39;s graffiti mural, these are no longer extant in the physical world and exist only in photographic archives. Asco intentionally did not make permanent murals and instead devised temporary public actions. Carrasco&#39;s mural of Los Angeles history was censored and lived in storage for many years, and just recently was acquired by the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History where it will remain on permanent view inside the museum. esparza and Ruiz have preliminary plans to redo the mural at The New Jalisco Bar and <i> Nostra Fiesta </i> will likely be painted over. Many of the artists in this show feel strongly that murals are meant to serve a moment in history, either as activist messages or as prompts for new generations of artists to visualize their own experiences. That is to say, these murals are a jumping off point for response, revision, and remaking. In public spaces&#8212;subject to the elements, urban change, tagging and erasure&#8212;these compositions may not remain forever on the wall, but their preservation, recognition, and legacy exists in many forms. 
              <br><br>
              This exhibition aims to be a resource for discovering, learning about, and preserving the legacy of these murals. While works made for specific locations face challenges in being presented in &#34;traditional&#34; exhibitions, work made by Chicane artists continues to be sidelined by major institutions in the United States. In some cases, a guiding objective is to correct documentation errors regarding the titles, contributors, even locations of these artworks. Moreover, the show proposes connections and affinities between works that exist across a geographic and chronological spread, uniting fifty years of artmaking in a sprawling city. To this end, the exhibition includes new photography to chronicle how murals appear today; explicatory descriptions of the six murals; an archive of objects, ephemera, and photographs related to each artwork; dialogues between artists either in the show or imbricated in these stories and their legacies; teaching guides for broad audiences to engage with the murals; and resources for further learning. We are especially proud to make this exhibition fully bilingual, honoring the choice of many of the artists in this show to incorporate both English and Spanish texts into their own artworks.
