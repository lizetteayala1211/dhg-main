                                <h2> TIMOI — <i> SPRAY&#8211;PAINT GRAFFITI MURAL ON THE <br> FACADE OF THE HIGHER PATH </i>, 2011 </h2> 
                                <p> Echo Park, Los Angeles </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="artwork-img-top-copy inner">
                                <p> After a dream in which an ancient spirit hosted within an eight-year-old&#39;s body visited them, the artist Timoi began the “Killer Calo” series (now known as &#34;Calo & Zovereignty, Galaxy the Great&#34;) in 2003. From the planet Ethenz, Calo (they/them) is a celestial figure whose planet functions as a haven for intersex, non-binary, and gender-fluid individuals named &#34;huemans.&#34; Existing alongside two other worlds Euphoniouz (cisgender men) and Oaziz (cisgender women), a binary symbolized by a moon and a sun, Timoi creates a unique, gender-expansive galaxy that affectionately teases the notion of genders being from different planets. In this spray-painted mural at <i> The Higher Path, </i> a cannabis dispensary formerly in Echo Park, Timoi employs Calo as both angel and alien&#8212;bringing the character&#39;s celestial light to bear on neighboring portraits of Jimi Hendrix, Nina Simone, and Mae West. 
                                <br><br>
                                In the mural, the figures wrap around the two walls of an outdoor patio with concrete floors. The smaller wall features Mae West spray painted blue, white, and purple to highlight her famed fair skin, platinum blonde hair, and exaggerated makeup. Immediately to her right, the phrase &#34;Go West You&#34; features prominently as the stylized words are blown onto her body, providing the protection of spirit from a floating Calo figure. On the large main wall, three significant figures and elaborate lettering spelling Timoi combine all the colors found in the mural. The singer Nina Simone rests on the left-hand side with a cigarette in her hand, a headwrap, dangling earrings, and a colorful shirt&#8212;each attesting to her well-documented personal style. A second Calo figure hovers in the center, wearing a gold chain that reads &#34;L.A.,&#34; blue lipstick and hair, and is doing a peace sign as they usher the sun and moon into the mural&#39;s cosmos. At right, Jimi Hendrix is depicted in green and black, mid-exhale while taking a drag of a cigarette with its smoke drifting and blending into the background as his voluminous afro forms a black halo around him.
                                <br><br>
                                In a single work, Timoi utilizes multiple graffiti conventions including complex lettering akin to &#34;wildstyle,&#34; the highly regarded tradition of irreplicable lettering incorporating texture and various colors designed to display an artist&#39;s skill. For instance, when painting their signature onto the mural, Timoi includes at least seven colors reflecting their name&#39;s acronym, &#34;trapped in my own imagination.&#34; Timoi&#39;s galaxy also turns the graffiti tradition of a &#34;heaven-spot&#34; on its head. Describing a difficult-to-reach location, such as a billboard, completing a heaven piece requires excellent skill and daring. Conceptually, the mural still aspires to this heavenly sensation: while firmly on ground level, it instead plays with the piece&#39;s location at a marijuana dispensary. Further, the floating heads&#8212;West, Simone, and Hendrix&#39;s portraits&#8212;suggest an earthly groundedness as Calo&#39;s extraterrestrial being hovers around them. This visual organization symbolizes Calo&#39;s descent to earth to support humanity and those marginalized in human and spiritual localities, simultaneously enveloping them in the sun and moonlight. Mae West is revered as an ardent LGBTQIA+ supporter; Nina Simone&#39;s bisexuality adds layers to her life and work history; and Jimi Hendrix was able to dodge the Vietnam draft by claiming to be &#34;homosexual,&#34; leading to long-standing speculations regarding his sexuality. Each of these artists&#39; proximity to <i> both  </i> queerness and creativity indicates the reasons Timoi and Calo chose them to protect and document in the imagined galaxy and space of the graffiti mural.
