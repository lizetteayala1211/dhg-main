                                <p> <i> Nostra Fiesta, </i> a mural commissioned for the facade of the historic New Jalisco Bar, reinterprets the famed Mexican printmaker José Guadalupe Posada&#39;s 1901 engraving that depicted a police raid targeting a drag ball in Mexico City&#39;s upper&#8208;class Colonia Tabacalera neighborhood. The subsequent arrests unjustly humiliated participants, as the scandal attracted significant public interest due to the group&#39;s affluence and speculations that the then&#8208;dictator Porfirio Díaz&#39;s son&#8208;in&#8208;law attended the gathering. At a time when class was at the forefront of Mexican sociopolitical dynamics, the forty&#8208;one arrested partygoers became symbolic of upper&#8208;class moral deviance. <i> Nostra Fiesta&#39;s </i> central dancing couple is pulled directly from Posada&#39;s piece, originally published in an Aguascalientes newspaper, <i> El Jicote, </i> alongside an insulting song and derogatory slurs.
                                <br><br>
                                In their mural, though, rafa esparza and Gabriela Ruiz focus on the surrounding party to honor its queer organizers. Moving beyond the formal ball setting, the artists reorient Posada&#39;s mocking image by incorporating a range of queer figures. For instance, three couples joyously dance as they are serenaded by musical icons Celia Cruz and Juan Gabriel and cared for by Nacho Nava, recalling angelic figures in <i> rest in peace </i> murals. Celia Cruz&#39;s signature tooth gap is highlighted alongside a version of her staple sculptural hair pieces, long nails, and vibrant clothing style. Juan Gabriel is found singing with a mischievous side&#8208;eye, wearing a patterned <i> charro </i> shirt and fringe dangling from his sleeves. Throughout his career, rumors regarding his sexuality followed Juan Gabriel with persistent speculation, yet he never publicly identified himself as queer. It is speculated his resistance to discuss romantic relationships was due to conservatism in Mexican culture, in this way, Ruiz and esparza&#39;s inclusion of Juan Gabriel becomes an embrace of his status as a queer icon. Nava is the sole figure confronting the mural&#39;s observer, his penetrative eyes imbued with the warmth of an attentive host that alludes to his career as an event producer for parties centering queer creatives of color in Los Angeles.
                                <br><br>
                                Around the mural, musical notes and star formations enliven the dance club setting, with Celia Cruz and Juan Gabriel as the showcase&#39;s performers. Meanwhile, two masculine figures dance together in cowboy hats and jeans, injecting <i> vaquero </i> aesthetics and nodding to Ranchera&#39;s Jalisco origins. In this way, the couple represents non&#8208;urban cultural traditions, which productively challenge elitist sentiments by including viewpoints articulated by farm workers and lower&#8208;class communities. Juan Gabriel bolsters this dimension of the mural, as his landmark career broadened Ranchera&#39;s audience and popularity. Another pair on the far&#8208;right side of the composition portrays two femmes eschewing gendered dress expectations that conform with Chicana modes of self&#8208;expression such as <i> Cholas </i> and <i> pachucos </i> (pervasive in both Mexican and American patriarchal cultural norms).
                                <br><br>
                                In the photographs of the mural at night commissioned for this exhibition, the composition&#39;s lavender colored background glows like a beacon of refuge, inviting New Jalisco Bar's LGBTQIA+ patrons with open arms defiantly contrasting the <i> lavender scare&#8212; </i> the mid&#8208;twentieth century &#34;moral panic&#34; in which queer United States government workers found themselves surveilled and fired en masse due to their sexuality. Although concerns around homophobia still limited some details in esparza and Ruiz&#39;s work, the mural is a powerful commemoration of cultural changes demanded and achieved by queer communities that have enabled explicitly queer expression in Los Angeles to move from the shadows onto a bar front.

                                        <b> Gabriela Ruiz, </b> born in 1991 in Los Angeles, explores shifting ideas of home and sentiments of belonging through cultural, socioeconomic, and personal frameworks. Blending diverse forms of creative expression through performance, sculpture, and installation, she investigates her relationship to her body and emotions, as well as the Mexican American experience, surveillance capitalism, mass consumerism, and the intersection of technology and emotion. Ruiz&#39;s practice reflects the DIY work ethic she was raised under, the vibrancy of Mexican cultural and artistic traditions, and her exposure to subculture and fantasy at a young age to escape the realities of daily life. Ruiz&#39;s most recent solo exhibition was at the Palm Springs Art Museum (2022), where she was an Outburst Projects resident. Her many group and solo shows include ones at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery, Los Angeles (2024); Anat Ebgi, Los Angeles (2022); Chicago Art Expo, Chicago (2022); and Museo de las Artes, Guadalajara (2019). In addition to exhibitions, Ruiz has staged various performances and collaborations. Recently, her work was acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Ruiz was the 2023 Jean Yokes Woodhead Visiting Artist at the University of Michigan.

                                        <b> Rafa Esparza </b> is a multidisciplinary artist who was born, raised, and currently lives in Los Angeles. Woven into Esparza&#39;s bodies of work are his interests in history, personal narratives, and kinship. He is inspired by his own relationship to colonization and the disrupted genealogies that it produces. Using live performance as his main form of inquiry, he employs site-specificity, materiality, memory, and what he calls (non)documentation as primary tools to investigate and expose ideologies, power structures, and binary forms of identity that establish narratives, history, and social environments. esparza is a recipient of Pérez Prize (2022); Latinx Arts Fellowship, Mellon Foundation (2021); Lucas Artist Fellowship (2020); Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (2017); Art Matters Foundation Grant (2014); and California Community Foundation Fellowship for Visual Artists (2014). Esparza has participated in residencies at Artpace San Antonio (2018) and Wanlass Artist in Residence, OXY ARTS, Los Angeles (2016). Solo exhibitions have been held at Artists Space, New York (2023); Commonwealth and Council, Los Angeles (2021); MASS MoCA, North Adams (2019); ArtPace, San Antonio (2018); and Ballroom Marfa (2017). Selected group exhibitions have been held at Museum of Contemporary Art Denver (2023); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2023); Commonwealth and Council, Mexico City (2022); Museum of Contemporary Art Tucson (2022); Moody Center for the Arts, Rice University, Houston (2020); San Diego Art Institute (2019); Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2017); and Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2016).
