                                <p> <i> Nostra Fiesta, </i> a mural commissioned for the facade of the historic New Jalisco Bar, reinterprets the famed Mexican printmaker José Guadalupe Posada&#39;s 1901 engraving that depicted a police raid targeting a drag ball in Mexico City&#39;s upper&#8208;class Colonia Tabacalera neighborhood. The subsequent arrests unjustly humiliated participants, as the scandal found significant public interest due to the group&#39;s affluence and speculations that the then&#8208;dictator Porfirio Díaz&#39;s son&#8208;in&#8208;law attended the gathering. At a time when class was at the forefront of Mexican sociopolitical dynamics, the forty&#8208;one arrested partygoers became symbolic of upper&#8208;class moral deviance. <i> Nostra Fiesta&#39;s </i> central dancing couple is pulled directly from Posada&#39;s piece, originally published in an Aguascalientes newspaper, <i> El Jicote, </i> alongside an insulting song and derogatory slurs.
                                <br><br>
                                In their mural, though, rafa esparza and Gabriela Ruiz focus on the surrounding party to honor its queer organizers. Moving beyond the formal ball setting, the artists reorient Posada&#39;s mocking image by incorporating a range of queer figures. For instance, three couples joyously dance as they are serenaded by musical icons Celia Cruz and Juan Gabriel and cared for by Nacho Nava, recalling angelic figures in <i> rest in peace </i> murals. Celia Cruz&#39;s signature tooth gap is highlighted alongside a version of her staple sculptural hair pieces, long nails, and vibrant clothing style. Juan Gabriel is found singing with a mischievous side&#8208;eye, wearing a patterned <i> charro </i> shirt and fringe dangling from his sleeves. Throughout his career, rumors regarding his sexuality followed Juan Gabriel with persistent speculation, yet he never publicly identified himself as queer. It is speculated his resistance to discuss romantic relationships was due to conservatism in Mexican culture, in this way, Ruiz and esparza&#39;s inclusion of Juan Gabriel becomes an embrace of his status as a queer icon. Nava is the sole figure confronting the mural&#39;s observer, his penetrative eyes imbued with the warmth of an attentive host that alludes to his career as an event producer for parties centering queer creatives of color in Los Angeles.
                                <br><br>
                                Around the mural, musical notes and star formations enliven the dance club setting, with Celia Cruz and Juan Gabriel as the showcase&#39;s performers. Meanwhile, two masculine figures dance together in cowboy hats and jeans, injecting <i> vaquero </i> aesthetics and nodding to Ranchera&#39;s Jalisco origins. In this way, the couple represents non&#8208;\urban cultural traditions, which productively challenge elitist sentiments by including viewpoints articulated by farm workers and lower&#8208;class communities. Juan Gabriel bolsters this dimension of the mural, as his landmark career broadened Ranchera&#39;s audience and popularity. Another pair on the far&#8208;right side of the composition portrays two femmes eschewing gendered dress expectations that conform with Chicana modes of self&#8208;expression such as <i> Cholas and pachucos </i> (pervasive in both Mexican and American patriarchal cultural norms).
                                <br><br>
                                In Guadalupe Rosales&#39;s photographs of the mural at night commissioned for this exhibition, the composition&#39;s lavender colored background glows like a beacon of refuge, inviting New Jalisco Bar's LGBTQIA+ patrons with open arms defiantly contrasting the <i> lavender scare&#8212; </i> the mid&#8208;twentieth century &#34;moral panic&#34; in which queer United States government workers found themselves surveilled and fired en masse due to their sexuality. Although concerns around homophobia still limited some details in esparza and Ruiz&#39;s work, the mural is a powerful commemoration of cultural changes demanded and achieved by queer communities that have enabled explicitly queer expression in Los Angeles to move from the shadows onto a bar front.

She received her associate of arts degree in English from West Los Angeles College before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles (BFA 1978). She was the first woman editor of the UCLA newspaper <i> La Gente. </i> At age nineteen Carrasco met César Chávez, leader of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), after which she began a long association with the organization.
