                                <p> Mural at the Ramona Gardens Housing Project, Los Angeles </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="artwork-img-top-copy inner">
                                <p> The earliest &#34;traditional&#34; mural in this exhibition is Judithe Hernández&#39;s <i> Homenaje a las Mujeres de Aztlán </i> (1979) at the Ramona Gardens Housing Project&#8212;a public housing development in Boyle Heights predominantly populated by Mexican and Central American families. Centering a strong female archetype, the mural pays homage to the resilience and achievements of Mexican women throughout time. Adorned with traditional vestments and jewelry, the towering figure raises one hand in a gesture of openness and trust while the other maternally cradles a host of figures and symbols. This intergenerational connection is advanced by the title: Aztlán refers to the mythical homeland of the Aztec civilization and establishes a matriarchal history of Mesoamerican indigeneity. The mural&#39;s dedicatory statement, two text panels that flank the composition at left and right in Spanish and English, reinforces this theme:  
                                <br><br>
                                Since the days of ancient history of México our women have always fought for the good of their family, their country, and their people&#8212;this mural is dedicated to them… The daughters, the mothers, and the grandmothers of Aztlán. 
                                <br><br>
                                In this ancestral narrative, the matriarch is mestiza&#8212;of both indigenous and Spanish colonial descent. When <i> muralismo </i> developed in Mexico under President Álvaro Obregón in the 1920s and 1930s, the government encouraged muralists to portray mixed race subjects as a testament to national unity. While this led to flattening simplifications of women as an idealized physical type, Hernández reoriented this trope by celebrating women&#39;s ability to encompass multiple identities. For example, the main figure&#39;s hair, styled in two coiled buns, aligns her with <i> las soldaderas </i>&#8212;female revolutionaries who provided aid for soldiers and occasionally took up arms in opposition to the dictatorship during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920). She also wears gold <i> arracada </i> earrings, identifiable by their crescent shape. The ubiquitous design dates back centuries and is a customary gift to young girls on their <i> quinceañera. </i> At the same time, she is loosely wrapped in a <i> rebozo </i>&#8212;a flat garment worn by women that connotes Mexican heritage and pride. During the Mexican Revolution, it was instrumentalized by a rebel cohort to carry babies and conceal weapons. Hernández&#39;s matriarch emphasizes how women utilized the physical body, dress, and self-presentation as symbols of the ways they were simultaneously displacing conservative idealizations of Mexican womanhood. In this way, the radical figure challenges stereotypical behaviors and social constructions engrained by misogynistic tropes. 
                                <br><br>
                                The smaller figures and symbols in the woman&#39;s arms are no less significant, each referencing elements of Mexico&#39;s matrilineal mythology. The lineage begins with Tonantzin (a Nahuatl word meaning &#34;our mother&#34;), who dons a maize crown and is considered the basis for the Catholicized Virgen de Guadalupe. Next, La Virgen appears in her customary blue robe and is engulfed by otherworldly light. A head-bust sculpture is wedged between these deities, referencing the Aztec goddess Coyolxāuhqui at Coatepec, now housed at the Museo Nacional de Antropología in México City. The remaining heroines are workers like agricultural laborers and a seamstress. Rounding out the assembly is a striking United Farmer Workers union member&#8212;marked by the union&#39;s insignia of the black eagle (another nod to the iconography of Aztlán), her overalls, and a picket sign that says: <i> &#34;Huelga! Viva U.F.W.&#34; </i>

                                        <b> Judithe Hernández, </b> born 1948 in Los Angeles, is a Chicana artist and a founding member of the Chicano Art movement and the Los Angeles Mural movement. The fifth and only female member of the acclaimed artist collective, &#34;Los Four,&#34; Hernández began her artistic career as a muralist working with Carlos Almaraz painting murals for César Chávez and the United Farm Workers Union. She is credited for painting one of the first feminist empowerment murals at the Ramona Gardens Housing Projects in East Los Angeles, on view in this exhibition. In 2011, Hernández&#39;s contributions to art were honored in the Getty Foundation sponsored arts initiative, Pacific Standard Time: Los Angeles Art 1945-1980. She was also featured in a public television documentary, and an installation about Los Angeles murals at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2012, she was one of the artists who helped inaugurate the new América Tropical Interpretive Center honoring the Mexican master David Alfaro Siqueiros and his mural. She received the prestigious C.O.L.A. Fellowship (City of Los Angeles Individual Artist Fellowship) in 2013. She is the subject of a solo exhibition, <i> Judithe Hernández: Beyond Myself, Somewhere, I Wait for My Arrival, </i> at The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art & Culture of the Riverside Art Museum.
