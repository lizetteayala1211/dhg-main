                                <p> When the annual Christmas Parade in East L.A. was canceled, the artist group Asco
                                    determined to stage their own procession along Whittier Boulevard, one of the
                                    neighborhood&#39;s main throughways. Asco&#8212;coming from a Spanish word meaning
                                    disgust or nausea&#8212;is now synonymous with a wave of public performances and
                                    other activations that commented on the internal dynamics and expectations of the
                                    group&#39;s neighborhood and Chicane culture in East L.A. Drawing upon filmic and
                                    photographic languages from popular culture to underground subcultures and
                                    surrealist imaginaries, the work addresses ingrained misogyny, cultural
                                    conservatism, as well as police brutality and racial profiling. In <i> The Walking Mural, </i> the group enacted a Christmas float utilizing Catholic symbology to
                                    spark confusion and a hallucinatory quality when the costumed characters
                                    unexpectedly paraded down the commercial street as if a mural had been peeled off
                                    the wall. At the time of the performance, several murals had been painted following
                                    the Chicano Moratorium of 1970, which also led to the restrictions against the
                                    parade. While unaware of one another&#39;s costumes before the performance, the
                                    three characters&#8212;an evergreen Christmas tree, the Virgin Mary, and
                                    Jesus&#8212;fomented a subversive reimagination of the traditional holiday
                                    procession, encapsulating how Asco routinely pushed against notions of an
                                    &#34;authentic&#34; and sanctioned Chicane cultural production within both their
                                    local community and outsider art world eyes.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Patssi Valdez, dressed primarily in black-and-white, portrays the Virgin of
                                    Guadalup&#8212;a brown-skinned apparition of Mary, which, according to legend,
                                    appeared to a sixteenth-century indigenous man named Juan Diego and became a beacon
                                    for mestizo and indigenous Catholics in Mexico and remains popular among many
                                    Mexican and Mexican American communities in Los Angeles and beyond. As Catholicism
                                    was introduced to the region through violent colonialist conversion tactics, the
                                    Virgin of Guadalupe&#39;s manifestation and steadfast adoption reflected the
                                    tenacity of a subjugated region to inject visions of itself into a domineering
                                    context, creating critical alternatives. In this way, Valdez stretches the
                                    Virgin&#39;s syncretic nature through the eyes of a late-twentieth-century Chicana
                                    attempting to forge a new pathway for herself. The artist recollects that while some
                                    community members found her interpretation sacrilegious, she was attracted to the
                                    Virgin as a &#34;pop icon,&#34; emphasizing the Virgin&#39;s mass appeal and
                                    chameleon-like manifestations across cultural spaces. Portraying Jesus, Willie
                                    Herrón III&#39;s painted cardboard backdrop enshrines his face as it bursts through
                                    the center, embellished by silver intersecting lines resembling a star. With a quick
                                    glance, onlookers driving down the boulevard might not have registered his human
                                    face as opposed to the three-dimensional sculptural form. Herrón&#39;s penetrating
                                    expression is buttressed by three morbid characters, perhaps representing the
                                    Biblical Magi&#8212;the three wise men who traveled to worship and bring gifts to
                                    the newly born Jesus. Meanwhile, a fanged mouth engulfing this consortium of
                                    characters attempts to devour them, intensifying the works apocalyptic undertones.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The pervasive darkness of Asco&#39;s character interpretations generates another
                                    reading of this work, which collapses the birth of Jesus and the rapture of the
                                    Second Coming of Christ. Some religious interpretations understand the rapture as
                                    one of social and political revolution, creating a new world and escape from false
                                    Christians who subjugate innocent people. For instance, the birth of a Christ
                                    figure, represented by Jesus during Christmas, was a politically revolutionary
                                    episode for occupied peoples in the Roman-controlled Levant and, therefore, connects
                                    the scene to the context of Chicano Movement&#39;s liberatory and activist efforts
                                    in the early 1970s. The desperate quest for protection and refuge is a key component
                                    of Christmas and, thereby, integrally frames the procession. To this point,
                                    Asco&#39;s performance begs the questions: What is a refuge when police brutality
                                    and other anti-Mexican sentiments unjustly shape one&#39;s life in East L.A.? And
                                    what is a refuge when your community does not understand and sometimes rejects your
                                    self-expression? Although Asco did not explicitly ask and should not be expected to
                                    answer these questions, The Walking Mural and the group&#39;s related performances
                                    served as confrontational demands for new forms of expression. And, at the very
                                    least, ushered in a new way to ask.

                                        <b> Asco </b> (1972&#8211;1987) began as a group of artists from East Los
                                        Angeles composed of Harry Gamboa Jr., Gronk, Willie Herrón, and Patssi Valdez.
                                        Taking their name from the Spanish word for disgust and nausea, Asco used
                                        performance, public art, and multimedia to respond to social and political
                                        turbulence in Los Angeles and beyond. Asco remained active until the mid-1980s,
                                        gaining new affiliates including Diane Gamboa, Sean Carrillo, Daniel J.
                                        Martinez, and Teddy Sandoval, among others. The collective&#39;s work has been
                                        celebrated by recent retrospective exhibitions, most prominently <i> Asco: Elite
                                        of the Obscure: A Retrospective, 1972-1987 </i> (2011) organized by the Los
                                        Angeles County Museum of Art and the Williams College Museum of Art. The core
                                        members met in high school in Los Angeles, and began producing work that
                                        responded to the Chicano Movement of the 1960s, yet differed in their reliance
                                        upon fiction and myth as counternarratives to the visual language typical of the
                                        Chicano Movement. By contrast, they developed their aesthetic and performative
                                        language from B-movies, glam rock, telenovelas, and Happenings. While some
                                        members were typically the performers or actors, Harry Gamboa Jr. served as the
                                        photographer&#8212;documenting these ephemeral activations for posterity.

                                        responded to the Chicano Movement of the 1960s, yet differed in their reliance
