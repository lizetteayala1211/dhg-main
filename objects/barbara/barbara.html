                                <h2> BARBARA CARRASCO — <i> L.A. HISTORY: A MEXICAN PERSPECTIVE </i>, 1981 </h2> 
                            </div>
                            <div class="artwork-img-top-copy inner">
                                <p> A sweeping network of vignettes are set into the flowing hair of <i> La Reina de Los Ángeles </i> (the Princess of Los Angeles) in Barbara Carrasco&#39;s multi-part mural, <i> L.A. History: A Mexican Perspective </i> (1981). Centering the contributions of Mexican migrants and their descendants, as well as indigenous peoples who lived in the region before Spanish colonial settlement in the 1700s, Carrasco unites together wide-ranging fields like agriculture, local politics, and the Hollywood film industry. Moreover, as the scenes narrate crucial events of the formation of Los Angeles, the mural constellates an intersectional history that pushes against the city&#39;s policies and practices that attempted to segregate racial minorities both geographically and culturally. By visualizing the city&#39;s diverse population, Carrasco reminds of the simultaneous survival, victories, and struggles of these communities.
                                <br><br>
                                Arranged chronologically from left to right, the mural starts with the region&#39;s pre-settlement history and culminates with political activism agitating for labor and housing equality in the present. Now on permanent display at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, where the artist conducted the bulk of the research for the mural, it was initially censored. When Carrasco refused to remove the fourteen scenes deemed too controversial for public display by the commissioning organization, the Community Redevelopment Agency, it was disassembled and put into storage. One compartment even chronicles the similar whitewashing of the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros&#39;s mural <i> América Tropical </i> (1932) made for an outdoor market in Downtown Los Angeles due to its overt critique of American imperialism&#8212;an earlier instance in which those in positions of power attempted to erase a public work contending with race, coloniality, and a Chicane imaginary.   
                                <br><br>
                                This mural&#39;s censored panels documented the Chicano Movement, as well as brutalities that impacted other ethnic groups like the 1871 massacre of twenty-two Chinese men and the Japanese American internment during World War II. One panel commemorates the triumphs of the Black community by giving a portrait of Bridget &#34;Biddy&#34; Mason, a freed slave who eventually became a nurse and founder of Los Angeles&#39;s First African Methodist Episcopal Church. Throughout, Carrasco considers housing, homebuilding, and the built environment as part of the city&#39;s history. For instance, one scene spotlights an indigenous domicile made of willow branches and tule (a durable grass) and depicts a worker gathering these natural resources. The artist also considers the ways that the physical landscape is often the source and site of oppression as another scene devises a visual metaphor for the practice of eminent domain, which claims private property for public use and frequently services segregation. Yet another depicts the transcontinental railroads rapidly built in the 19th century and enabled by the exploitation of Chinese laborers. Carrasco undertook extensive research into this under examined racial atrocity, looking through the archives of the Chinese Historical Society for letters and documents that shed light on these events. 
                                <br><br>
                                As the mural progresses, community gathering spaces like churches and markets, and eventually skyscrapers, provide possible stability amid episodes of racial strife, as if to remind that shared spaces allow for communion and relationality. The project itself is one of collaboration: Carrasco employed seventeen students from the Summer Youth Employment Program to assist with the mural. In a display of gratitude, she included their portraits. A final ensemble also portrays celebrities, politicians, and &#34;community members&#34;&#8212;including portraits of Yreina Cervántez and Harry Gamboa Jr, two other artists in this exhibition.

                                        <b> Barbara Carrasco </b>, a mixed-media artist, was born in El Paso, Texas, in 1955 to Mexican American parents and grew up in the predominantly Mexican American and African American community of Mar Vista Gardens, near Culver City, California. She received her associate of arts degree in English from West Los Angeles College before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles (BFA 1978). She was the first woman editor of the UCLA newspaper <i> La Gente. </i> At age nineteen Carrasco met César Chávez, leader of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), after which she began a long association with the organization. She designed and created flyers and banners for the UFW. In 1981 Carrasco was commissioned by the Community Redevelopment Agency to create a sixteen-by-eighty-foot portable mural titled <i> LA History: A Mexican Perspective. </i> Carrasco is a founding member and board member of the Dolores Huerta Foundation. Students and scholars of her work can find her original mural sketches and drawings in the Permanent Collection of Works on Paper at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC; her oral history is archived by the Smithsonian Archives of American Art and UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center; and a permanent collection of her papers has been established and archived at Stanford University&#39;s Special Collections.
