                                <p> Located beneath an overpass on 2nd Street and Toluca in Downtown Los Angeles, Yreina Cervántez&#39;s mural <i> La Ofrenda </i> (1989) is dedicated to Dolores Huerta, the Chicana activist who agitated for civil liberties and farmworkers rights as a founder of the United Farmworkers Union. A prolific organizer, Huerta galvanized major labor strikes including the nationwide table grapes boycotts in the 1960s. Smiling at the center of the mural in a red button-down shirt, Huerta is the venerated subject of this <i>&#34;ofrenda&#34;&#8212;</i> a home altarpiece typically constructed by women across Mexico on holidays such as <i> Día de los Muertos. </i> Customary elements of the offering displays are placed throughout the mural, such as votive candles and calla lilies. Other devotional items include an <i> Ojo de Dios </i> (a woven rhombus that represents the eye of God and signifies omniscient sight), while elsewhere narrative scenes show sage burning and prayer. In one vignette, a man wearing a sombrero bends over to pick corn while a nearby deity lurking among the stalks, possibly the Aztec-Mexica goddess <i> Chicomaecoatl, </i> is shrouded with her hands in a gesture of prayer&#8212;promising a bountiful harvest. Huerta, though best known as a labor activist, also asserted that spirituality and religious traditions were effective tools in the quest for political, economic, and racial equality. In this way, the mural aligns the achievements of the Chicano Movement, labor reform, and migrant rights with Mesoamerican rituals, artmaking, and agricultural traditions.
                                <br><br>
                                The mural also uses text and layered meanings. &#34;Mujer,&#34; a poem by Sara Martinez, is painted onto monumental open palms at top right. Here, the poet speaks to women&#39;s transformative agency to overcome adversity and suffering through work, collectivity, and hope. Another poem in both Spanish and English, &#34;Vende Futuro,&#34; by Gloria Enedina Alvarez runs along the bottom edge of the mural atop an abstract landscape of mountains and valleys through which figures appear to cross, visualizing the trials of migration. The poem gives: &#34;We cross “the line&#34; between four points, common points on long paths.” The bilingual statement emphasizes the border struggles of the Chicane community in the United States, particularly the challenges of geographic and cultural displacement. In this way, <i> La Ofrenda </i> comes to protect the new immigrants to the city&#8212;shielding them from the lightning and helicopters which may, in turn, symbolize the potential geological threats to migrants during journeys across borders and to the government systems that surveil and persecute. To this point, the snake and lightning explicitly recollect the realities of border crossing via the desert (an idea reinforced elsewhere).
                                <br><br>
                                For Cervántez, this mural occasioned an opportunity to speak against the maltreatment of migrants from Central America&#8212;through both visual and textual material and direct community engagement. She worked with Chicane and Central American youth assistants and local graffiti artists on the project, which also served as her culminating thesis of her master&#39;s degree from UCLA. Ultimately, <i> La Ofrenda </i> celebrates moments of cultural unification, in which women like Huerta bridge many worlds (ancestral, spiritual, political) to assure the rights and liberties of the oppressed in the present.
