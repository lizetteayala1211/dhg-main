            <p class="introduction">
              Five Decades of Chicane Muralism in Los Angeles gathers six murals made in Los Angeles from 1972 to 2019.
              By bringing together dispersed works of public art in the digital space, the show traces the evolution of
              this mode of artistic expression so crucial to the city’s Chicane visual and cultural identity. On freeway
              underpasses, freestanding buildings, community centers, bars, and commercial venues, visual artists have
              taken hold of the wall as a platform for political activism, social commentary, and community building for
              decades. These muralists utilized the large-scale format not only as platforms for celebration but
              moreover as vehicles of critical socio-political commentary––reflecting on dynamics of citywide violence,
              economic disenfranchisement, and the exclusion of Central and South migrants and their descendents from
              formal and informal artistic institutions. Over time, the works in this exhibition have become
              cornerstones of the neighborhoods in which they exist, cherished memories of those who live among or have
              witnessed them. All the same, the works evidence a categorical expansion of the mural in this context,
              encompassing experimental intermedial practices, performances recorded by photographs, censored works that
              were relegated to storage or permanent destruction, or graffiti tags and imagery.
              <br><br>
              This exhibition aims to be a resource for discovering, learning about, and, in turn, preserving these
              murals, which, in their fundamental logic, resist transport precluding their display in “traditional”
              exhibitions and expose them to the elements and threats of erasure and destruction. Through this digital
              dialogue, Five Decades of Chicane Muralism in Los Angeles creates a database for major murals in the city
              made principally by Chicane artists. In some cases, a guiding objective is to correct the long-standing
              documentation errors regarding the titles, contributors, even locations of these artworks. Moreover, the
              show proposes connections and correspondences between works that exist across a geographic and
              chronological spread, unity fifty years of artmaking in a sprawling city. In their intersectional focus on
              women, femme subjects, migrants, and other marginalized groups, these artists galvanized the evolution of
              a visual aesthetic and ideology which challenged social stereotypes within and beyond their communities.
              These radical gestures overlapped with civil rights reform, feminism, and gay liberation. In this way, the
              works addressed and redressed sociocultural conditions that hampered artistic freedom and access, like
              sexism and homophobia within Mexican-American communities and police surveillance and the censorship of
              protests and activism.
              <br><br>
              Contemplating these six murals in tandem, one observes how the large-scale format and positionality
              allowed artists to visualize complex (oftentimes, corrective) historical narratives, impart messages and
              communal values, contemplate the relationship between place and identity, and communicate on both public
              and deeply personal levels. To this end, the exhibition includes new photography to chronicle how murals
              appear today, explicatory descriptions of the six murals, an archive of objects, ephemera, and photographs
              related to each artwork, dialogues between artists either in the show or imbricated in these stories and
              their legacies, teaching guides for broad audiences to engage with the murals, and resources for further
              learning. We are especially proud to make this exhibition fully bilingual, honoring the choice of many of
              the artists in this show to incorporate both English and Spanish texts into their own artworks.
              <br><br>
              Public art by Mexican and Central American immigrants and their descendants in Southern California has led
              to a vital reconfiguration of muralism, and public art more generally: using shared spaces to both
              contemplate and create local culture and identity. Developing alongside the Chicano Movement (El
              Movimiento), from the beginning of the Los Angeles mural movement, the mass format provided public space
              for artists to complete sanctioned commissions that both asserted the presence of Chicane communities and
              galvanized the period’s revolutionary ideology––attesting to the nascent intersectionality between racial
              identity, labor reform, protest, and liberatory politics. Over time, community leaders established groups
              aimed at the preservation and perpetuation of the mural as a vehicle for underrepresented communities. In
              1976, the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) was founded by a team of artists to support public
              art throughout the city––“taking its name from the notion that it takes only a spark to start a prairie
              fire.”
              <br><br>
              Murals and other public works, like banners, were often commissioned to accompany protests and other
              activist missions. The painter Barbara Carrasco, for instance, worked closely with the United Farmer
              Workers (UFW) led by César Chavez and Dolores Huerta, most typically producing banners for conventions. As
              Carrasco recounted in an oral history interview, she approached Chavez when a student about opportunities
              to contribute to the cause through art: “And I immediately volunteered my services to him. I said, "I
              would like to do anything for you. I draw really well. If you want me to go on a picket line, I'll do
              that." And I had no idea that I would work with him for fifteen years.” Labor activists became potent
              symbols of public murals, including Yreina Cervantéz’s La Ofrenda (1989-1990), which honors Huerta. While
              Huerta is the centerpiece of the composition, the mural capaciously honors the resilience of farmworkers,
              Chicana women, and Central American migrants in the United States––evidencing the intersectional symbolism
              that leaders such as Huerta communicated.
              <br><br>
              Many of the works in this exhibition speak to the dislocations of the immigrant experience and the
              interconnected realities of assimilation, oppression, and alterity, while, simultaneously, preserving
              artistic traditions, community values, and ancestral cultures as a means of resistance and solidarity. In
              Los Angeles, the visual arts (from murals to poster design and printmaking) directly aided activist
              causes. From the earliest works in the exhibition, like Judithe Hernández’s mural Homenaje a los Mujeres
              de Aztlán of 1976, murals provided a vehicle for political statements and calls to action. While a
              celebration of Mesoamerican matriarchal indigenous traditions, the heroines of the Mexican Revolution, and
              the Chicane labor activists and members of the UFW,, the mural also signaled a crucial characteristic of
              murals made in Los Angeles. This new generation of painters, which increasingly included women, radically
              evaluated the format’s own limiting conventions, as well as cultural conservatism of Mexican and Chicane
              communities. Hernández’s overtly feminist mural challenged the essentializing and stereotypical depictions
              of women typical of murals. A powerful and capacious figure, Herández’s monumental matriarch symbolized
              Chicane women’s agency to both maintain tradition and participate in radical action, from fighting
              alongside male revolutionaries to agitating for labor reform. Hernández, the first woman allowed entry
              into “Los Four” (Los Angeles’s answer to “Los Tres Grandes” of the earlier Mexican mural movement), helped
              break down barriers for other women artists to obtain commissions and permission to work on large-scale
              murals––a privilege traditionally reserved for their male counterparts.
              <br><br>
              To this day, the best known muralists are the all-male members of “Los Tres Grandes”: José Clemente
              Orozco, Diego Rivera, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. By extension, the most recognizable murals owe to the
              zenith of the post-revolutionary Mexican mural movement of the 1920s and 1930s: typically “permanent,”
              government-sanctioned commissions in purportedly public centers (in actuality, many of these murals were
              not accessible either inside prestigious schools or the offices of high-ranking public servants).
              Moreover, both the muralists and their sponsors intentionally thwarted women from participating in the
              movement. In an emblematic instance, Rivera and Siqueiros even teamed up to prevent María Izquierdo from
              completing a government commission to paint the staircase of the Departmento del Distrito Federal
              building. In brief, these artists averred that women were incapable of partaking in what they marketed as
              a hyper-masculine, hyper-physical craft. With generational and geographic distance, women artists in Los
              Angeles have battled the legacy of these misogynistic practices, arguing that women have a place not only
              within the mural’s visual imagery or as nationalist symbols, but moreover as creators, actors, and
              cultural producers. Participating in the legacy of muralist resistance, that at once critiques oppression
              and violence against nonconforming subjects and artistic production which upholds these values, the most
              recent work in the show, rafa esparza and Gabriela Ruiz’s Nostra Fiesta (2019) adorns the façade of The
              New Jalisco Bar––a nightclub that serves the Latinx LGBTQ community of downtown Los Angeles. Celebrating
              the venue’s embrace of gender non-conformist customers and performers, as well as working class locals and
              immigrants, the mural disrupts long standing discriminatory values that situated the mural within
              heteronormative tropes.
              <br><br>
              As the murals made in Los Angeles query the gender dynamics of Mexican art and culture, the artists in
              this exhibition also tapped into shared sources like the artforms and mythology of pre-conquest
              Mesoamerican civilizations, the lessons of Mexican muralism, the broader history of Chicane art and
              politics, the visual culture and built environment of Los Angeles. At the same time, Chicane muralists
              continued to utilize the conventions of the format, like the centralization of monumental figures and its
              capacity to present sweeping historical narratives, to voice alternate visions. Homages to formidable
              women and narrations of marginalized events and silenced groups predominate these works. As discussed,
              Hernández’s mural project for the Ramona Gardens Housing Project narrates a matrilineal, diasporic history
              that unites the mythical progenitors of the Aztec civilization with Chicane labor activists of the
              twentieth century. To Hernández, the subject matter directly confronted the shortcomings of the mural
              movement: “We made the conscious decision to design murals dedicated to women in response to all the
              male-dominated subject matter of most Chicano murals of the era.”
              <br><br>
              Another artwork, Barbara Carrasco’s multi-part, portable mural L.A. History: A Mexican Perspective (1981),
              provides a monumental portrait of “La Reina de Los Ángeles” (“The Princess of Los Angeles”) with nearly
              forty scenes chronicling important events in the city’s formation set into a web of vignettes in La
              Reina’s flowing hair. While focusing on the contributions of the Chicane population to culture,
              infrastructure, and politics, the intersectional history imbricates other marginalized communities and
              their stories. The potency of this mural exists, in part, through the implication that a radical history,
              which honors multicultural contributions and condemns racialized violence and exploitation, exists in the
              space provided by feminine power and beauty––namely, that of La Reina’s flowing hair. Carrasco’s mural
              also spotlight the work of other women, like the freed slave Bridget “Biddy” Mason who founded the First
              African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles and Yreina Cervántez, a fellow artist who assisted with
              the project. Eight years later, Cervántez went on to make her first major mural, La Ofrenda, which
              commemorated Dolores Huerta. Composed on a large wall of a freeway underpass in Downtown Los Angeles, the
              project both celebrated the achievements of the Mexican-American community organizer and the artmaking
              practices of women from Mexico. Surrounding Huerta with objects typically found in a traditional “ofrenda”
              (offering), Cervántez visualized the intergenerational and matrilineal connections to land, spirituality,
              and agriculture. Her work also critiqued the maltreatment of migrants from Central America in the United
              States, contemplating the perils of crossing the border, the surveillance of immigrants, and the
              marginalization of these communities. Far from the nationalizing rhetoric of Mexican murals produced in
              the wake of the Mexican Revolution, La Ofrenda exists in a precarious spatiality of errancy, exile, and
              escape. Here, the mural’s free-floating figures and objects and darting bodies refer to the displacement
              wrought by cultural assimilation and migration.
              <br><br>
              In this way, though inspired by certain qualities of muralismo, the murals made in Los Angeles activate
              their own artistic languages that upend hegemonic claims to permanence, historical determinism, and
              absolutism. This is, in part, evidenced by the expansion of the mural over the last fifty years by Chicane
              artists in Los Angeles as they tackled questions of gender, representation, and inclusivity from within a
              highly sanctified mode of visuality. In so doing, these artists expanded the very definition of the mural
              by encompassing portable objects, performance, photography, graffiti, and erasure. To this point, the
              exhibition includes the art collective Asco’s The Walking Mural (1972), a documented performance that
              directly challenged the idea that the Chicane experience could only be valorized by sanctioned murals.
              Here, a member of the group, Patssi Valdez [flesh out]. Similarly, the Los Angeles-based graffiti artist,
              Timoi, has undertaken dozens of murals across the city––including what she recollects as “risky” missions
              to take on particularly ambitious graffiti projects on the sides of freeways. In some cases, these
              transgressions explicitly reject traditional power dynamics within the art world and Chicane communities.
              For some, like Asco, the temporary act cut against muralism’s promise of permanence and eternality. To
              Timoi, proving herself and honing their craft meant acceptance among the male graffiti artists who did not
              readily accept women into their groups. The risks of tagging structures also included the possibility that
              their work might be partially covered up by other graffiti artists or intentionally erased by city
              officials.
              <br><br>
              Another dimension of the work presented in this exhibition is marked by the wholesale embrace of
              collective work and community spirit. Carrasco paid homage to her team of assistants by painting their
              portraits in one of the narrative frames. Cervántez, then a young art student, is among those portraits.
              As Carrasco recently reflected: “The artists, when you’re working on a mural, the first thing is that you
              have to be compatible and respect one another. I liked Yreina and I thought she would be perfect. She’s
              good with people, good with kids.” Later, Cervántez hired Chicane and Central American student workers as
              mural assistants when she earned the commission for La Ofrenda. She also included the work of two poets
              and a graffiti artist, crediting each by name within the composition. Hernández’s mural for the Ramona
              Gardens Housing Projects was designed in concert with Carlos Almaraz’s mural La Adelita, jointly asserting
              the role of women in social revolution. Nostra Fiesta is the work of an artist pair.

              In these works, collectivity extends beyond process: many artists turned to understudied archives and
              records to rebuild histories that have been pushed to the margins. While preparing L.A. History: A Mexican
              Perspective, Carrasco poured over materials in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, scoured
              newspaper articles, and exhumed stories of racial prejudice and exploitation. esparza and Ruiz cite
              emblems of Mexican art, specifically a print made by José Guadalupe Posada in their mural for the New
              Jalisco Bar. As will be explored in this exhibition, they crucially reconceived the print’s overarching
              ideology and details, effectively negating the heteronormative prejudices of Posada’s original work and
              Mexican society under the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz. In Timoi’s graffiti mural for The Higher Path, a
              marijuana dispensary, they produced a counterhistory of Los Angeles’s mainstream entertainment industry by
              highlighting gender nonconforming performers Jimi Hendrix and Mae West.
