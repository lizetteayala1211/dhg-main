Her research centers on the intersection of photography and liberation movements through a global lens. Her dissertation explores the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) photography department, emphasizing their innovative contributions to the 1960s Black Freedom Movement. Titled &#34;Visions of Liberation: Gender and Photography in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 1960-1970,&#34; the dissertation examines how SNCC&#39;s internal gender dynamics influenced their photographic output in a crucial decade that reshaped photography&#39;s position in U.S.-based organizing. She has held positions at the National Gallery of Art, the Grey Art Gallery, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Duke University Press, Open Book Publishers, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the Museum of Modern Art have published her writing. She is currently serving as the Program Director of the Billie Holiday Theatre&#39;s Black Arts Initiative. Additionally, she is collaborating on a photo and poetry book with writer Jess Cole.

                                    <b> Mario Ayala </b> (b. 1991, Los Angeles) reimagines a contemporary landscape
                                    where identity, observation, and the presence of material fact play equal roles. In
                                    his paintings, Ayala brings together figures and forms drawn from every corner of
                                    his experience living on the West Coast. Ayala&#39;s work lends interest in
                                    traditions and techniques with strong visual ties to California, such as muralism,
                                    tattooing, and industrial techniques used in automobile painting and commercial
                                    signage, and his influences also extend into postwar art historical movements such
                                    as the Cool School of Los Angeles and Bay Area Funk art. Ayala&#39;s highly
                                    personal, often surreal, tableaux are vivid representations of the way in which
                                    images course through the world, carrying with them fragments of the past, present,
                                    and a future still in formation. His creations live as collectively inspired
                                    documents that reflect issues, energies, and aesthetics alive in Mexican American,
                                    Latin, and Brown communities throughout the region. Ayala&#39;s sculptures,
                                    site-specific works, and collaborations embody his capacity to envision the local
                                    and the global as interwoven phenomena. Like his paintings, they locate
                                    surprising—and even unsettling—moments of cohesion in a world defined by
                                    multiplicity and rapid, ever-changing flux.

                                    <b> Adela Tapia </b> is an art historian based in Southern California. Her research
                                    focuses on the progressive tactical offensive waged by Chicanas of the 1960s against
                                    institutionalized colonial oppressions such as sexual hierarchy, religious shaming,
                                    and assimilation. She emphasizes the intersectional oppressions unique to Chicanas
                                    in the 1960s including invisibility, assimilation/loss of identity, gender vs.
                                    cultural conflicts, traditional gender roles, imposed relational identities, and the
                                    perils of Chicana feminism. A published essayist, her writing is featured in catalog
                                    for the 2024 retrospective of Judithe Hernández, <i> Beyond Myself, Somewhere, I

                                    California State University, Fullerton. Her thesis excavates Chicanas&#39;
                                    strategic, decolonial interventions as evidenced through the visual framework of the
                                    art of Judithe Hernández.
