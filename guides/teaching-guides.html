                                    Instructor gives a brief lesson on Chicane Murals using some of the examples from the digital exhibition. Students are asked to describe murals seen in their city and neighborhoods. Students are given 30 minutes to find information about the murals in their neighborhood and save images of some of the murals they like the best. Students will also gather information on location, artist, and year the mural was painted as they are researching.

                                    <i> Think critically </i> &#8212; Students will discuss why they believe the mural is in their neighborhood and what themes and/or historical messages the mural represents.

                                    <br>
                                    This lesson plan involves going on a tour of murals in East Harlem. Prior to the day of the trip, split the class into three groups. Group A will learn about Julia de Burgos, Group B will learn about Frida Kahlo, and Group C will learn about Nicholasa Mohr. For younger classrooms, please see the suggested readings below. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    While at the murals suggested, hold mini discussions. Each group will present what they know and learn about the person in the mural. Educators can refer to the guiding questions to elaborate on each mural and encourage student participation. The tour should last about an hour (with discussion time included). 
                                </p>

                                    <br>
                                    This lesson plan involves going on a tour of murals in East Harlem. Prior to the day of the trip, split the class into three groups. Group A will learn about Julia de Burgos, Group B will learn about Frida Kahlo, and Group C will learn about Nicholasa Mohr. For younger classrooms, please see the suggested readings below. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    While at the murals suggested, hold mini discussions. Each group will present what they know and learn about the person in the mural. Educators can refer to the guiding questions to elaborate on each mural and encourage student participation. The tour should last about an hour (with discussion time included).
